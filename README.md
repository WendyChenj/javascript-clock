# Countdown Timer

Project 5 from freeCodeCamp.

This project is built using React, HTML & CSS.

### Project Objectives:

Given basic HTML and CSS files, use front end library React to create a javascript clock timer which shows session and break time left and "beep" when time is up.

1. Clicking the start button will make the timer running. And the timer can be stopped or resumed counting at any time.

2. When a session/ break countdown reaches to zero, a sound will be played indicating that time is up.

3. The session/ break length is set between 1 and 60.

4. Click the reset button, the session/ break length and timer will be set to the initialized state. The sound will stop playing and be rewound to the beginning.
